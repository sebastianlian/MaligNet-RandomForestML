# **Predictive Oncology Insights**

## **Machine Learning-Based Insights for Oncology**

This project was born out of a desire to provide doctors with a **personal AI companion** that leverages **data analytics and machine learning** to improve breast cancer treatment recommendations. Inspired by **Hacklytics GT 2025**, we aimed to develop a highly accurate **predictive model** to assist clinicians in identifying key risk factors and optimizing treatment decisions. 

Through extensive **machine learning training and fine-tuning**, we developed an **optimized Random Forest model** that achieves **over 90% accuracy** in predicting patient survival outcomes, ensuring reliable and interpretable insights for clinicians.
